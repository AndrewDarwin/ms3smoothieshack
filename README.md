Smoothie Shack is a recipe website for people who love smoothies. The website is a place where users can be inspired, view and search for recipes, as well as add their own recipes.
Users are welcome to create an account and add their smoothie recipes. If the user has an account, he/she can add, edit and delete their recipes.

# User Experience (UX)

* Constructing a full-stack site/app that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask and MongoDB.

* Creating an easy to navigate site/app that serves as a platform where users can be inspired for smoothie ideas and where they can share their smoothie recipes.

* Designing a full-stack site/app that allows users to manage data and can make use of CRUD (create, read, update and delete) for the recipes.

## User stories

### First-time visitor goals:

* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through the website, so I can find everything easily.

* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to understand the intent of the page

* As a first time visitor, I want to see an overview of all recipes, so I can be inspired by all recipes.

* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to browse and search for recipes based on words, so I can find recipes easily. (For example, I can search the word pineapple and all recipes with the ingredient pineapple or pineapple in the recipe name will appear.)

* As a first time visitor, I want to register an account on the website, so I can share my recipes on Smoothie Shack.

* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to visit the website on every device, so that I can look at the website on desktop, mobile and tablet.

### Registered User goals:

All the goals of first-time visitors also apply for registered users. There are additional user stories to the site members because they have more access to the website (when logged in).

* As a registered user, I want to add my recipes, so I can share my recipes on the site.

* As a registered user, I want to be able to view my recipes that I’ve submitted to the site.

* As a registered user, I want to edit my recipes, so I can update information in the recipe.

* As a registered user, I want to delete my recipes, so I can remove the recipe for whatever reason.

* As a registered user, I want to login to my profile, so I have access to my recipes.

* As a registered user, I want to be able to logout of my profile.

## 5 Planes UX

### Strategy

My goal was to develop an appealing recipe website for people who love smoothies. Smoothie Shack is a place where users can be inspired, view and search for recipes, as well as add their own recipes. I aimed to have a nice layout and clean design - consistent in style and colour throughout.

### Scope

For ease of use, Smoothie Shack contains a Navigation bar which is simple and easy to navigate, as well as a search Function. There are also functions to Function to add a recipe, edit a recipe and delete a recipe. The recipes can be only edited/deleted by the creator. The website is visually appealing by use of smoothie images, and nice colours which do not make the text unreadable. 

### Structure

I structured the layout in a user friendly interface and the content in an easily readable way for the user. There’s a Navigation bar at the top of the page with responsive navigation - adjusting for mobile for ease of use, and a Footer at the bottom of every page. All images and features are responsive for mobile and desktop viewing.
